Sipur Hozer - Employee Management System📚 About The ProjectSipur Hozer is a second-hand bookstore chain with 20 branches across Israel that employs individuals with employment barriers. The organization emphasizes professional and social development for its employees.Currently, employees report their work hours and job roles on two separate, disconnected platforms. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a unified, accessible mobile-first application that handles both time tracking and role reporting.Key ObjectivesUnification: Combine entry/exit time recording and job role logging into one streamlined app.Accessibility: Designed specifically for users with diverse backgrounds and needs, featuring a high emphasis on simplicity and accessibility adjustments (e.g., text-to-speech, high contrast).Management: Provide managers with tools to approve shifts, manage locations, and export data for salary/reward calculations.🚀 FeaturesFor EmployeesUnified Login: Simple authentication via phone number and password.Shift Tracking: Easy Clock-in/Clock-out interface.Location Awareness: Ability to report shifts inside the store or outside.Role Reporting: Mandatory selection of specific job roles performed during the shift.Accessibility: User interface optimized for ease of use and accessibility.For ManagersDashboard: Manage multiple store locations and user roles.Shift Verification: Review, approve, or reject submitted shifts.Reports: Export detailed reports for monthly salary and reward calculations.User Management: Add employees and assign permissions.🛠️ Technology StackThis project is built using a modern, scalable architecture designed for high performance and reliability.BackendLanguage: Go (Golang)Framework: Gin-GonicChosen for high execution speed, low resource consumption, and ability to handle high concurrency.FrontendFramework: Next.js (React)Chosen for server-side rendering capabilities, performance, and modern mobile-first UI development.DatabaseDatabase: PostgreSQLChosen for ACID compliance and strong SQL capabilities to ensure data integrity for financial/reward calculations.Infrastructure & DevOpsContainerization: Docker & Docker ComposeCI/CD: Automated pipelines for linting, testing, and building production images.🏗️ Architecture OverviewThe system follows a microservices-oriented approach:Application (Client): Next.js frontend interacting with the API.API Server: Go/Gin server handling business logic, authentication, and shift management.Database: PostgreSQL instance storing sensitive user data, shifts, and roles.💻 Getting StartedPrerequisitesDocker and Docker ComposeOptional (for local dev without Docker): Go 1.20+, Node.js 18+, PostgreSQLInstallation & RunningThe easiest way to run the entire system is using Docker Compose.Clone the repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/sipur-hozer-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/sipur-hozer-project.git)
